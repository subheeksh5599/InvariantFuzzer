# solana-cpi-safety-skill

Solana CPI safety skill for Claude Code — detects and prevents four cross-program invocation vulnerability classes, with first-class coverage of CPI return-data spoofing.

## What it is

Cross-program invocation is Solana's most common source of severe, exploitable bugs. This skill teaches Claude Code to recognize, explain, and fix the four classes that account for the majority of High and Critical audit findings:

### The four CPI vulnerability classes

| Class | Risk | What goes wrong |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| **CPI return-data spoofing** | Critical | Trusting `get_return_data()` without verifying the producing program. Any program can write to the return-data slot — a rogue caller replaces an oracle price before your program reads it. |
| **Arbitrary CPI** | High | Invoking a caller-supplied program id — enables fake SPL Token programs and attacker-controlled code executing inside the victim vault. |
| **Stale account after CPI** | High | Reading account state a callee mutated without reloading from the ledger. |
| **PDA CPI signing** | Medium-High | `invoke_signed` with non-canonical bumps or leaked signer seeds — enables unauthorized signing. |

### The novel core: CPI return-data spoofing

The crown-jewel coverage is CPI return-data spoofing. It is the least-documented of the four classes and the hardest to catch in review. The attack surface is the `set_return_data` / `get_return_data` syscall pair: any program invoked before yours (or by yours) can overwrite the slot. A DeFi program that calls an oracle CPI and then reads `get_return_data()` without checking `program_id == ORACLE_PROGRAM_ID` is fully exploitable.

This skill is anchored on a real upstream-fixed finding: Anchor CPI return-data spoofing, CVSS 7.5, fixed upstream, placing 1st of 116 across a 14-protocol audit.

Both Anchor and native/Pinocchio patterns are covered.

### The /audit-cpi command

Invoke `/audit-cpi` in any Claude Code session to scan a Solana repository for all four CPI vulnerability classes and produce a structured finding report with remediation steps.

### The cpi-auditor agent

A dedicated sub-agent that performs systematic CPI audits. Routes to the appropriate sub-skill for each finding class, writes exploit PoC sketches, and proposes fixes aligned with Anchor or native/Pinocchio idioms.

### The rust.md rule

A Rust code rule with Cursor-style `globs:` frontmatter (shipped as `rust.md` so it renders on GitHub). In Cursor it auto-loads on Rust file edits and routes CPI-touching changes to the relevant sub-skill and `cpi-checklist.md`. Claude Code has no auto-on-edit rule mechanism, so there it is reference material the skill cites — or drop it into a project `.claude/rules/` (with `paths:` frontmatter) for path-scoped context.

### Runnable PoCs

Five runnable PoCs cover the four vulnerability classes — the crown-jewel class (return-data spoofing) ships both an Anchor and a Pinocchio proof. Each PoC pairs on-chain programs (attacker + victim) with a TypeScript LiteSVM test suite running EXPLOIT / DEFENSE / POSITIVE CONTROL cases. Programs are Anchor except where noted:

**poc/return-data-spoofing/** (crown jewel; 6 cases)
- EXPLOIT: victim adopts the spoofed price written by the attacker program
- DEFENSE: `UntrustedProducer` error raised when the producer check fails
- POSITIVE CONTROL: accepts return data from the real oracle program
- Variant B (deeper-stack leak): a benign relay surfaces a deeper program's return data — EXPLOIT adopts a deep attacker's spoof, DEFENSE rejects it via the producer check, POSITIVE accepts the real oracle

**poc/pinocchio-return-data/** (crown jewel, Pinocchio; 3 cases)
- The same exploit and fix as the Anchor return-data PoC, written against raw Pinocchio (`pinocchio::cpi`, `AccountView`, `Address`) and built with `cargo-build-sbf`
- One `consumer` program selects the unchecked vs checked path via a one-byte instruction discriminator (0 = vulnerable, 1 = fixed)
- EXPLOIT adopts the attacker's spoofed `1`; DEFENSE rejects with `UntrustedProducer`; POSITIVE accepts the trusted oracle's `50_000`

**poc/arbitrary-cpi/**
- EXPLOIT: attacker substitutes a fake SPL Token program; attacker-controlled code executes inside the vault's CPI
- DEFENSE: explicit program_id check rejects the substitution before any CPI is opened
- POSITIVE CONTROL: the real SPL Token program succeeds

**poc/account-reload/**
- EXPLOIT: a vulnerable consumer checks a pre-CPI balance snapshot, so a vault drained by the CPI passes a solvency check
- DEFENSE: the fixed consumer re-reads after the CPI (the `reload()` lesson) and rejects the drained vault
- POSITIVE CONTROL: a partial withdrawal that stays solvent is accepted

**poc/pda-cpi-signing/**
- EXPLOIT: a vault PDA signs (`invoke_signed`) with seeds `[b"vault", authority]`, but the authority is never required to sign — an attacker drains a victim's vault by passing the victim's pubkey unsigned
- DEFENSE: the fixed program requires the authority to sign, rejecting the unsigned drain
- POSITIVE CONTROL: the real authority withdraws from its own vault
- A second test file (`non-canonical-bump.test.ts`) covers the non-canonical-bump facet: a vulnerable program creates a one-per-user registry PDA via `invoke_signed` with a caller-supplied bump, so an attacker registers the same user twice (canonical then a non-canonical bump) to mint duplicate accounts; the fixed program pins the canonical bump via `find_program_address`

## Quickstart

### Install

One-line install (recommended) — full bundle (skill + `/audit-cpi` command + `cpi-auditor` agent), global (`~/.claude`):

```bash
npx @rector-labs/solana-cpi-safety-skill
# project-local instead: npx @rector-labs/solana-cpi-safety-skill --project
```

Skill-only, via the open agent-skills ecosystem:

```bash
npx skills add RECTOR-LABS/solana-cpi-safety-skill
```

As a native Claude Code plugin (full bundle), via the RECTOR-LABS marketplace:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add RECTOR-LABS/claude-plugins
/plugin install solana-cpi-safety@rector-labs
```

From a clone (runs the same installer locally):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/subheeksh5599/InvariantFuzzer.git
cd InvariantFuzzer
node bin/cli.mjs                      # global (~/.claude)
# project-local: node bin/cli.mjs --project              # ./.claude
# custom base:   node bin/cli.mjs --target <dir>         # <dir> is a config base: installs <dir>/skills, <dir>/commands, <dir>/agents
```

Then restart Claude Code. Note: installed as a plugin the command is namespaced `/solana-cpi-safety:audit-cpi`; via npx or the local installer it is `/audit-cpi`.

### Run a PoC

The compiled programs and their keypairs are committed, so the PoCs run with Node alone — no Solana/Anchor toolchain required.

```bash
# Return-data spoofing PoC
cd poc/return-data-spoofing
npm install
npm test
```

6 tests run, 6 pass (Variant A + Variant B deeper-stack):
- EXPLOIT: "vulnerable consumer trusts spoofed return data" — tx succeeds, consumer
  adopts attacker-set price 1 (spoofed value confirmed in return data)
- DEFENSE: "fixed consumer rejects attacker oracle" — tx fails with error UntrustedProducer
- POSITIVE CONTROL: "fixed consumer accepts legitimate oracle" — tx succeeds, consumer
  reads real oracle price 50000
- Variant B (deeper-stack leak): EXPLOIT adopts a deep attacker's spoof through a benign
  relay; DEFENSE rejects it via the producer check; POSITIVE accepts the real oracle

```bash
# Arbitrary CPI PoC
cd poc/arbitrary-cpi
npm install
npm test
```

3 tests run, 3 pass:
- EXPLOIT: "vault_vulnerable accepts fake_token program substitution" — tx succeeds,
  return data byte 0 = 1 proving fake_token (attacker program) executed
- DEFENSE: "vault_fixed rejects fake_token program substitution" — tx fails with error
  WrongTokenProgram
- POSITIVE CONTROL: "vault_fixed accepts real_token" — tx succeeds, return data byte 0 = 0

```bash
# account-reload (stale-account-after-CPI) PoC
cd poc/account-reload && npm install && npm test
# pda-cpi-signing (invoke_signed) PoC
cd poc/pda-cpi-signing && npm install && npm test
# pinocchio-return-data (Pinocchio crown-jewel variant) PoC
cd poc/pinocchio-return-data && npm install && npm test
```

These run the same EXPLOIT / DEFENSE / POSITIVE CONTROL shape (3 tests each).

#### Rebuild the programs from source (optional)

With Anchor 1.0.2 and the Solana toolchain installed, run `anchor build` inside an Anchor `poc/<scenario>/` directory. The `pinocchio-return-data` PoC is built with `cargo-build-sbf` instead (see CLAUDE.md for the toolchain notes). The committed program keypairs keep the program ids stable across rebuilds.

### Use in Claude Code

After installing, open any Claude Code session in a Solana project and ask:

```
Audit this program for CPI vulnerabilities
/audit-cpi
Are there any return-data spoofing risks in programs/my-program/src/lib.rs?
Review this CPI call for arbitrary-program substitution
```

## Adding to Solana AI Kit

The kit (solanabr/solana-ai-kit) registers external skills as git submodules under `.claude/skills/ext/<name>`. To add this skill:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/RECTOR-LABS/solana-cpi-safety-skill.git .claude/skills/ext/solana-cpi-safety
```

The resulting `.gitmodules` block (ready to paste):

```
[submodule ".claude/skills/ext/solana-cpi-safety"]
    path = .claude/skills/ext/solana-cpi-safety
    url = https://github.com/RECTOR-LABS/solana-cpi-safety-skill.git
```

## Requirements (for the PoCs)

To run the PoCs (primary path — programs are precompiled):

| Tool | Version |
|------|---------|
